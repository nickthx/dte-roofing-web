## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 3-phase structure -- data/schema first, then linking, then hub enhancements
- [Roadmap]: Hub H1 change to "Areas We Serve in Central Ohio" to stop Columbus cannibalization
- [Phase 01]: Geo coordinates standardized to 39.9637153, -83.1477371 across schema files
- [Phase 01]: BUSINESS_INFO.areaServed computed from LOCATIONS array at module level for consistent 13-city-only output

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Service area map implementation (Phase 3) may need a research spike for lightweight options (static SVG vs interactive)
- [Research]: aggregateRating async fetch may miss Googlebot render -- low priority, deferred to v2
